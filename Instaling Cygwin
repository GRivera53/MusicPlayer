We need to be in a terminal, so need to install cygwin

browse to c:\ 

and create a new folder named cygwin_packages where it can download all packages and git and all stuff

then in select packages 
we select git distributed version control system
also ssh to make connections to servers

adding we install nano that helps to edit files
also...
and wget -> web

and thats all you can add whatever you want or packages you feel comfortable with.
